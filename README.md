# 🦀 Rough Rust  

Welcome to **Rough Rust**, a journey into learning the Rust programming language! This repository contains projects, challenges, and exercises as I progress through tutorials on [CodeSignal Learn](https://learn.codesignal.com/). 🚀  

## 🌟 About  
This repository is my sandbox for exploring Rust, a powerful systems programming language. From building basic programs to diving into advanced concepts, this repo showcases my progress as I master Rust.  

**Note**: Everything in this repository is part of my learning process. Even the commits I make are intended to help me understand Git and GitHub better as part of my journey in code development. Mistakes and iterations are part of the learning curve! 🌱

## 📚 Tutorials  
All tutorials and exercises are inspired by resources from [CodeSignal Learn](https://learn.codesignal.com/) and other online materials.
